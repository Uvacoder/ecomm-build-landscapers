# Build A-Dream

This was a project I started when I first was getting into web which was to create a new website for my Dad's Landscaping business. It has been through a lot of changes and has been a great way to help me learn. It was originally created using HTML,CSS but recently I remade it all in Svelte for added functionality and performance.
