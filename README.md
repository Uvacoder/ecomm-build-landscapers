# Build A-Dream

Live: https://build-a-dream.vercel.app/

This was a project I started when I first was getting into web which was to create a new website for my Dad's Landscaping business. It has been through a lot of changes and has been a great way to help me learn. It was originally created using HTML/CSS but since then it has been remade in Svelte & Vue. Checkout other branches to see the previous versions.
